- Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
- of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
-
-			    Preamble
-
-  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
-freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
-License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
-software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This
-General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
-Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to
-using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
-the GNU Library General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to
-your programs, too.
-
-  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
-price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
-have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
-this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
-if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
-in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.
-
-  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
-anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
-These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
-distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.
-
-  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
-gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
-you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
-source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their
-rights.
-
-  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
-(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
-distribute and/or modify the software.
-
-  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
-that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
-software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
-want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
-that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
-authors' reputations.
-
-  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
-patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
-program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
-program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
-patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.
-
-  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
-modification follow.
-
-		    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
-   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
-
-  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains
-a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
-under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program", below,
-refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"
-means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:
-that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,
-either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
-language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
-the term "modification".)  Each licensee is addressed as "you".
-
-Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
-covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
-running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program
-is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the
-Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).
-Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.
-
-  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
-source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
-conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
-copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
-notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;
-and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License
-along with the Program.
-
-You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
-you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.
-
-  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
-of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
-distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
-above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
-
-    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
-    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
-
-    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
-    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any
-    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third
-    parties under the terms of this License.
-
-    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
-    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
-    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
-    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a
-    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide
-    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under
-    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this
-    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but
-    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on
-    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)
-
-These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
-identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,
-and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
-themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
-sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
-distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
-on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
-this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
-entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.
-
-Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
-your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
-exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
-collective works based on the Program.
-
-In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
-with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of
-a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
-the scope of this License.
-
-  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
-under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
-Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:
-
-    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
-    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections
-    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,
-
-    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
-    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
-    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
-    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
-    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
-    customarily used for software interchange; or,
-
-    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
-    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is
-    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
-    received the program in object code or executable form with such
-    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)
-
-The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
-making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source
-code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
-associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
-control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a
-special exception, the source code distributed need not include
-anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
-form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
-operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
-itself accompanies the executable.
-
-If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
-access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
-access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
-distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
-compelled to copy the source along with the object code.
-
-  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
-except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
-otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
-void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
-However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under
-this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
-parties remain in full compliance.
-
-  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
-signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
-distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are
-prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
-modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
-Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
-all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
-the Program or works based on it.
-
-  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
-Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
-original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
-these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
-restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
-You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
-this License.
-
-  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
-infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
-conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
-otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
-excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
-distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
-License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
-may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent
-license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by
-all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
-the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
-refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.
-
-If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
-any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
-apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
-circumstances.
-
-It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
-patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
-such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
-integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
-implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
-generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
-through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
-system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
-to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
-impose that choice.
-
-This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
-be a consequence of the rest of this License.
-
-  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
-certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
-original copyright holder who places the Program under this License
-may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
-those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
-countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates
-the limitation as if written in the body of this License.
-
-  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
-of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
-be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
-address new problems or concerns.
-
-Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
-specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
-later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions
-either of that version or of any later version published by the Free
-Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of
-this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
-Foundation.
-
-  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
-programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author
-to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free
-Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes
-make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals
-of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and
-of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.
-
-			    NO WARRANTY
-
-  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
-FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN
-OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
-PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED
-OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
-MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS
-TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE
-PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
-REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
-
-  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
-WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
-REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
-INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING
-OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED
-TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY
-YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
-PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
-POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
-
-		     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
-
-	    How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
-
-  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
-possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
-free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.
-
-  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
-to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
-convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
-the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
-
-    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
-    Copyright (C) 19yy  <name of author>
-
-    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
-    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
-    the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or
-    (at your option) any later version.
-
-    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
-    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
-    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
-    GNU General Public License for more details.
-
-    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
-    along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software
-    Foundation, Inc., 59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307  USA
-
-
-Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
-
-If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this
-when it starts in an interactive mode:
-
-    Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) 19yy name of author
-    Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.
-    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
-    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.
-
-The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate
-parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may
-be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be
-mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.
-
-You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
-school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if
-necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:
-
-  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program
-  `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.
-
-  <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1989
-  Ty Coon, President of Vice
-
-This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into
-proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may
-consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the
-library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library General
-Public License instead of this License.

-a52dec-0.7.3 Wed Feb 20 23:38:22 PST 2002
--rewrite of the imdct code, making a52dec 40% to 80% faster than version 0.7.2
--fixed one memory corruption problem in parse.c
--small liba52 portability fixes
--byte order and CRLF bugfixes in wav file output
--aif file output
--IRIX al sound output (untested, tell us if it works)
-
-a52dec-0.7.2 Sun Dec 16 14:39:56 PST 2001
--demuxer improvements, with support for TS streams.
--smaller demux buffer, making it easier to use a52dec as a pipe
--wav output
--avoid -fPIC when possible (-prefer-non-pic)
--support for vc++ and TenDRA
--portability fixes
-	
-a52dec-0.7.1b Fri Aug 31 02:37:23 PDT 2001
--removed an #include <stdint.h> that was only breaking libc5 builds
-
-a52dec-0.7.1 Thu Aug 30 02:13:23 PDT 2001
--gcc 3.0 fixes
--mlib fixes (now passes the test suite)
--in a52dec.c, made sample_data and flags static
--removed a few statics in liba52/parse.c (still not reentrant, but closer)
-
-a52dec-0.7.0 Thu Aug 23 23:18:00 PDT 2001
--Downmix to arbitrary speaker configurations
--Dynamic range compression
--Major speedups: 2x for 2.0 streams with 2.0 output,
-                 3x for 5.1 streams with 2.0 output.
--New library interface
--Rematrixing bugfix
--Higher precision
-
-ac3dec-0.6.1 Mon Mar 27 20:27:06 EST 2000
--Fix another 2.0 problem (rematrix was wrong).
--Fix the never resync on a bad crc bug.
-
-ac3dec-0.6.0 Sat Mar 18 19:43:25 EST 2000
--New library interface 
--Fix bug wrt coupling channels that was causing sound quality problems. 
--Fix 2.0 mode problems (aka the I forgot to implement the phase flags bug). 
--All around speed improvements (almost twice as fast) 
--Improved robustness when fed bad data. The entire frame is checksummed before playback.
-
-ac3dec-0.5.6 Tue Nov 16 00:37:34 EST 1999
--Irix support 
--Alpha fixes 
--Minor performance enhancements to downmix and imdct
--OpenBSD fixes 
--extract_ac3 can now read from stdin
--Change output_linux to block on write instead of using the
- ring buffer. Let me know if this causes/fixes any problems
-
-ac3dec-0.5.5 Wed Aug 25 15:36:44 EDT 1999
--Fixed a cut and paste bug (argh!) in parse.c which potentially 
- screwed up delta bit allocation info.
--Martin Mueller <mamueller@topmail.de> informed me that I was missing
- some corrections from the AC-3 errata document. It turns out that 
- I used an earlier version of the errata when I initially wrote ac3dec.
- Fortunately the errata fix the outstanding bugs that I was pulling
- my hair out on for a long time. Woohoo! Thanks Martin. Kudos to Dolby
- Labs for keeping their documentation up to date as well.
--stereo downmixing (downmix.c) is now in. Matrix encoded surround 
- (Dolby Prologic Surround) should work too.
--clipping due to high level signals has been fixed. We normalize a
- block of samples by its maximum absolute value if the max exceeds 
- the %100 digital level. This shouldn't be a problem, but for some 
- reason some channels have a dynamic range that exceeds [-1.0,1.0].
- I blame the encoder :)
--Multiple track support in extract_ac3. Simply just give it the track
- number you want [1,8] after the filename.
-
-ac3dec-0.5.4 Thu Jul 29 16:55:10 PDT 1999
--Fixed a stupid bug with the coupling channel that was causing
- high frequencies to be attenuated.
--Re-wrote the extract_ac3 tool.
--Added to a tool to verify the checksums on a given AC3 stream. 
- (tools/verify_ac3)
-
-ac3dec-0.5.3  Mon Jul 12 10:45:56 PDT 1999
--Fixed problems related to streams with coupling channel enabled.
--Minor performance enhancements
-
-ac3dec-0.5.2  Sun Jul  4 12:00:25 PDT 1999

-ABOUT LIBA52
-
-liba52 is a free library for decoding ATSC A/52 streams. It is
-released under the terms of the GPL license. The A/52 standard is used
-in a variety of applications, including digital television and DVD. It
-is also known as AC-3.
-
-The main goals in liba52 development are:
-
-      *	Portability - Currently all of the code is written in C, and
-	when we write platform-specific optimizations we will always
-	keep a generic C routine to fall back on.
-
-      *	Reuseability - we do not want liba52 to include any
-	project-specific code, but it should still include enough
-	features to be used by very diverse projects.
-
-      *	Precision - We are trying to implement all of the A/52
-	standard, and to have a very precise output by doing all the
-	calculations in floating point. We have a test suite that
-	detects any deviation in the output when compared to previous
-	versions. We do not have access to official A/52 test vectors
-	though, so we have to use our judgement to ensure that such
-	deviations are only intruduced when we fix bugs !
-
-      *	Speed - liba52 is really fast, on any modern PC it should take
-	only a few percent of CPU time.
-
-The project homepage is at http://liba52.sourceforge.net/
-
-
-A52DEC
-
-a52dec is a test program for liba52. It decodes ATSC A/52 streams, and
-also includes a demultiplexer for mpeg-1 and mpeg-2 program streams.
-
-The liba52 source code is always distributed in the a52dec package, to
-make sure it easier for people to test it.
-
-The basic usage is to just type "a52dec file" where file is an ATSC
-A/52 file.
-
-The "-s" option must be used for multiplexed (audio and video) mpeg-2
-files. These files are usualy found on the internet or on unencrypted
-DVDs.
-
-The "-o" option is used to select a given output layer. By default
-a52dec does a stereo downmix and outputs to your speakers, but you can
-try other choices using this option. This is also used for performance
-testing and conformance testing.
-
-The "-c" option is used to disable all optimizations (currently only djbfft).
-
-The "-r" option is used to disable the dynamic range compression.
-
-
-OTHER PROJECTS USING LIBA52
-
-liba52 (and its ancestor libac3) is being used by various other
-projects, including:
-
-      *	xine (http://xine.sourceforge.net/) - started as a simple
-	mpeg-2 audio and video decoder, but it since became a
-	full-featured DVD and video media player.
-
-      *	MPlayer (http://www.MPlayerHQ.hu) - another good player, it is
-	also very robust against damaged streams.
-
-      *	movietime (http://movietime.sourceforge.net/) - still quite
-	young, but it looks very promising !
-
-      *	ffmpeg (http://ffmpeg.sourceforge.net/) - a nice audio/video
-	encoder and transcoder, uses liba52 for decoding A/52 streams.
-
-      *	Ogle (http://www.dtek.chalmers.se/groups/dvd/) - a good DVD
-	player with menu support
-
-      *	OMS (http://www.linuxvideo.org/oms/)
-
-      *	XMPS (http://xmps.sourceforge.net/)
-
-      *	GStreamer (http://www.gstreamer.net/) - a framework for
-	streaming media; it has an A/52 decoding plugin based on liba52.
-
-      *	mpeglib (http://mpeglib.sourceforge.net/) - a video decoding
-	library that usess liba52 when decoding A/52 streams.
-
-If you use liba52 in another project, let us know !
-
-VideoLAN (http://www.videolan.org/) does not use liba52, but this is
-still a cool project :)
-
-
-TASKS
-
-There are several places where we could easily use some help:
-
-      *	Web design: This site sucks ! at the very least, we'd like to
-	come up with a nicer background picture and a logo.
-
-      *	Testing: If you find any stream that does not decode right
-	with liba52, let us know ! The best thing would be to mail to
-	the liba52-devel mailing list. Also if you have access to
-	encoders, we'd love to get test streams that would be free of
-	rights - so that we can put them on this server.
-
-      *	Coding: you can have a look in the TODO file first ! The most
-	important item is probably to make the code fully reentrant.
-
-      *	Porting: If you're porting to a new architecture, you might
-	want to experiment with the compile flags defined in
-	configure.in . When you figure out whats fastest on your
-	platform, send us a patch !
-
-
-REFERENCES
-
-The A/52 standard is publically available at these locations:
-
-      *	http://www.atsc.org/standards/a_52a.pdf - The main part of the
-	standard, as published by the ATSC.
-
-      *	http://www.dolby.com/tech/ATSC_err.pdf - A list of erratas in
-	the ATSC standard, published by Dolby. It applies to the
-	previous revision of the standard (A/52 not A/52a), but some
-	erratas have not been fixed in the updated standard yet !
-
-
-CVS SNAPSHOTS
-
-A daily snapshot is created using "make distcheck" every night and
-uploaded to http://liba52.sourceforge.net/files/a52dec-snapshot.tar.gz .
-It is easier to use than the CVS repository, because you do not need
-to have the right versions of automake, autoconf and libtool
-installed. It might be convenient when working on a liba52 port for
-example.
-
-
-CVS REPOSITORY
-
-The latest liba52 and a52dec source code can always be found by
-anonymous CVS:
-
-# export CVSROOT=:pserver:anonymous@cvs.liba52.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/liba52
-# cvs login (Just press Return when prompted for a password)
-# cvs checkout a52dec
-
-You can also browse the latest changes online at
-http://cvs.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/liba52/a52dec/
-
-The other CVS modules are ac3dec-livid for the CVS history of the
-project while it was still hosted on the linuxvideo.org servers, and
-ac3dec for the CVS history of the project while the linuxvideo.org
-servers were down and before the library switched its name to liba52.

-MAILING LISTS
-
-See the subscription information at http://liba52.sourceforge.net/lists.html
-
-liba52-devel
-
-This is the main mailing list for technical discussion about
-liba52. Anyone wanting to work on liba52, or maybe just stay informed
-about the development process, should probably subscribe to this list.
-
-liba52-checkins
-
-All liba52 checkins are announced there. This is a good way to keep
-track of what goes into CVS.
-
-liba52-announce
-
-This is a very low traffic mailing list, only for announcements of new
-versions of liba52. Only project administrators can post there.

-
-To assign environment variables (e.g., CC, CFLAGS...), specify them as
-VAR=VALUE.  See below for descriptions of some of the useful variables.
-
-Defaults for the options are specified in brackets.
-
-Configuration:
-  -h, --help              display this help and exit
-      --help=short        display options specific to this package
-      --help=recursive    display the short help of all the included packages
-  -V, --version           display version information and exit
-  -q, --quiet, --silent   do not print \`checking...' messages
-      --cache-file=FILE   cache test results in FILE [disabled]
-  -C, --config-cache      alias for \`--cache-file=config.cache'
-  -n, --no-create         do not create output files
-      --srcdir=DIR        find the sources in DIR [configure dir or \`..']

-
-Some influential environment variables:
-  CC          C compiler command
-  CFLAGS      C compiler flags
-  LDFLAGS     linker flags, e.g. -L<lib dir> if you have libraries in a
-              nonstandard directory <lib dir>
-  CPPFLAGS    C/C++ preprocessor flags, e.g. -I<include dir> if you have
-              headers in a nonstandard directory <include dir>
-  CPP         C preprocessor
-
-Use these variables to override the choices made by `configure' or to help
-it to find libraries and programs with nonstandard names/locations.

-   If the caller did not specify anything,

-

-   stop option processing when the first non-option is seen.
-   This is what Unix does.
-   This mode of operation is selected by either setting the environment
-   variable POSIXLY_CORRECT, or using `+' as the first character
-   of the list of option characters.
-
-   PERMUTE is the default.  We permute the contents of ARGV as we scan,
-   so that eventually all the non-options are at the end.  This allows options
-   to be given in any order, even with programs that were not written to
-   expect this.
-
-   RETURN_IN_ORDER is an option available to programs that were written
-   to expect options and other ARGV-elements in any order and that care about
-   the ordering of the two.  We describe each non-option ARGV-element
-   as if it were the argument of an option with character code 1.
-   Using `-' as the first character of the list of option characters
-   selects this mode of operation.
-
-   The special argument `--' forces an end of option-scanning regardless
-   of the value of `ordering'.  In the case of RETURN_IN_ORDER, only
-   `--' can cause `getopt' to return -1 with `optind' != ARGC.  */

-/* Scan elements of ARGV (whose length is ARGC) for option characters
-   given in OPTSTRING.
-
-   If an element of ARGV starts with '-', and is not exactly "-" or "--",
-   then it is an option element.  The characters of this element
-   (aside from the initial '-') are option characters.  If `getopt'
-   is called repeatedly, it returns successively each of the option characters
-   from each of the option elements.
-
-   If `getopt' finds another option character, it returns that character,
-   updating `optind' and `nextchar' so that the next call to `getopt' can
-   resume the scan with the following option character or ARGV-element.
-
-   If there are no more option characters, `getopt' returns -1.
-   Then `optind' is the index in ARGV of the first ARGV-element
-   that is not an option.  (The ARGV-elements have been permuted
-   so that those that are not options now come last.)
-
-   OPTSTRING is a string containing the legitimate option characters.
-   If an option character is seen that is not listed in OPTSTRING,
-   return '?' after printing an error message.  If you set `opterr' to
-   zero, the error message is suppressed but we still return '?'.
-
-   If a char in OPTSTRING is followed by a colon, that means it wants an arg,
-   so the following text in the same ARGV-element, or the text of the following
-   ARGV-element, is returned in `optarg'.  Two colons mean an option that
-   wants an optional arg; if there is text in the current ARGV-element,
-   it is returned in `optarg', otherwise `optarg' is set to zero.
-
-   If OPTSTRING starts with `-' or `+', it requests different methods of
-   handling the non-option ARGV-elements.
-   See the comments about RETURN_IN_ORDER and REQUIRE_ORDER, above.
-
-   Long-named options begin with `--' instead of `-'.
-   Their names may be abbreviated as long as the abbreviation is unique
-   or is an exact match for some defined option.  If they have an
-   argument, it follows the option name in the same ARGV-element, separated
-   from the option name by a `=', or else the in next ARGV-element.
-   When `getopt' finds a long-named option, it returns 0 if that option's
-   `flag' field is nonzero, the value of the option's `val' field
-   if the `flag' field is zero.
-
-   The elements of ARGV aren't really const, because we permute them.
-   But we pretend they're const in the prototype to be compatible
-   with other systems.
-
-   LONGOPTS is a vector of `struct option' terminated by an
-   element containing a name which is zero.
-
-   LONGIND returns the index in LONGOPT of the long-named option found.
-   It is only valid when a long-named option has been found by the most
-   recent call.
-
-   If LONG_ONLY is nonzero, '-' as well as '--' can introduce

-   The LONG_OPTIONS argument to getopt_long or getopt_long_only is a vector

-   The field `has_arg' is:
-   no_argument		(or 0) if the option does not take an argument,
-   required_argument	(or 1) if the option requires an argument,
-   optional_argument 	(or 2) if the option takes an optional argument.
-
-   If the field `flag' is not NULL, it points to a variable that is set
-   to the value given in the field `val' when the option is found, but
-   left unchanged if the option is not found.
-
-   To have a long-named option do something other than set an `int' to
-   a compiled-in constant, such as set a value from `optarg', set the
-   option's `flag' field to zero and its `val' field to a nonzero
-   value (the equivalent single-letter option character, if there is
-   one).  For long options that have a zero `flag' field, `getopt'

-   missing arguments, `optopt' is set to the option letter, and '?' is

-
-   The OPTS string is a list of characters which are recognized option
-   letters, optionally followed by colons, specifying that that letter
-   takes an argument, to be placed in `optarg'.
-
-   If a letter in OPTS is followed by two colons, its argument is
